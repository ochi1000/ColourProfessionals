            <h3>About Us</h3>
            <p>The idea of Colour Professionals was born on August 13, 2019, by a few working class people taking up the challenge to create a digital paint and coating business. From understanding the nuance of this business through effective investigations in other companies and research studies: it was evident that thebpath to its revolution was down to changing some of its business art which limited more options (colours), accountability (exactness/reproducibility) and convenience (customer satisfaction). Given the result it gathered, there was a unanimous agreement that creating a new culture was imminent, and would also be most benefitting for the best qualities available today, at an affordable cost.</p>
            <p>On October 5, 2019, Colour Professionals acquired a Laboratory site at No.6 Pipeline Road, Umuebulu II Etche L.G.A, Rivers State which provided low rent cost. It ran as a non-profit organization sponsored by its founders with support from friends and well-wishers, and was focused to solve the problem of limited options and accountability through scientific research. During this period, our research studies and experimentation provided findings which made Colour-pro one of the best colour problem solvers available in the business today. After succeeding to meet its colour goals and quality control targets, it proceeded to find its products using the current research methods which assured standard paint and coating embeddedness. Today, Colour Professionals has 13 different best quality products in the business (8 paints and 5 coatings).
            </p>
            <p>On July 6, 2020, Colour Professionals acquired its manufacturing center within proximity to the Laboratory. It also started its research to solve the third problem: customer satisfaction. It achieved this using software and online programming tools which enabled one to see or get closer to realizing our clientâ€™s imagination and/or perspective. The opportunity provided by using this platform also served Colour-pro to widen its horoscope in the interior decoration business.</p>
            <p>Colour Professionals were certified under the Nigeria Corporate Affairs Commission (CAC) for business by September 2020. It also started generating profit from product sales, paying its debts and establishing itself in the community during this period. Colour-pro is structured in a decentralized manner such that decision making and management are overseen by its shareholders. There are also directors set in place to manage operations, research, distribution, legal and human resource affairs.</p>
            <p>Today, Colour-pro is currently working toward acquiring a center in Port Harcourt city, where it hopes to establish itself among the leading paint and coating industries in the state and beyond by September 2021. It also seeks to use this medium to raise awareness and source for investors to enable us achieve this great goal.</p>

            <p><span>Our objective</span> as Colour Professionals is to achieve optimal quality in our products by embedding the features of decorations, reproducibility, protection and longevity which make it the best today as well as in the future through research.</p>

            <h3>ColourPro Simulation Experience</h3>
            <p>This is a novel and modern concept we have introduced and champion in the paint and coating industries. It involves using our software application to simulate the final look of our painting job, therefore you can see the final look of your rooms and spaces even before the job is started, therefore you get the choice of adjustments.</p>
